# Sandbox 01: Theory-as-Channel (Compression as Communication)

**Idea:** Treat ensemble/student predictions as a communication channel; use error correction and channel capacity.

**Viability test:** Run ErrorCorrectingPredictions on synthetic ensemble outputs; compute channel_capacity for a simple SNR scenario.

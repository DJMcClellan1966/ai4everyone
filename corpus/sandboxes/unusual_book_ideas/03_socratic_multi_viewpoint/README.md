# Sandbox 03: Socratic Multi-Viewpoint (RAG debate)

**Idea:** Retrieve chunks tagged by viewpoint; present as a short "Bishop vs Goodfellow vs practice" debate.

**Viability test:** Use a few hardcoded "viewpoint" chunks; run SocraticQuestioner on a statement; assemble 2 viewpoints + one question.

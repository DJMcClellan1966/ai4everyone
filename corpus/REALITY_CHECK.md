## ⚠️ **IMPLEMENTED BUT UNTESTED** (20-30%)

### Advanced Concepts
- ⚠️ **Quantum Mechanics Features**: Code exists, but not rigorously tested
  - Heisenberg Uncertainty Regularizer
  - Schrödinger Wave Function Evolution
  - Bell Inequality
  - **Reality**: Mathematical implementations exist, but practical ML benefits unproven

- ⚠️ **Science Fiction Concepts**: Implemented but experimental
  - Neural Lace: Basic interface exists
  - Precognition: Forecasting code exists

  - **Reality**: Interesting concepts, but practical impact unclear

- ⚠️ **Advanced Agent Features**: Code exists, integration unclear
  - Jungian Psychology: Archetype analysis implemented
  - Turing Test: Framework exists
  - **Reality**: Components work individually, full integration untested

### Performance Claims
- ⚠️ **"1000x faster"**: May be true for cached queries, but not general case
- ⚠️ **"50-90% faster"**: Caching helps, but not always applicable
- ⚠️ **"Revolutionary features"**: Many are experimental

## ❌ **WISHFUL THINKING** (10-20%)

### Overstated Claims
- ❌ **"Complete Explainability"**: Basic XAI exists, but "complete" is impossible
- ❌ **"Perfect Reproducibility"**: Can improve, but "perfect" is impossible
- ❌ **"Eliminating All Bias"**: Can reduce bias, but "all" is impossible
- ❌ **"Divine Omniscience"**: Preemptive responses work, but not truly omniscient
- ❌ **"Quantum Advantage"**: Quantum simulation exists, but no real quantum advantage

### Integration Claims
- ❌ **"Fully Integrated"**: Many components exist independently, full integration untested
- ❌ **"Production Ready"**: Some components are, many are not
- ❌ **"All Features Work Together"**: Many features are isolated

### Performance Claims
- ❌ **"Always 1000x faster"**: Only true for specific cached scenarios
- ❌ **"Works for all problems"**: Works for many, not all
- ❌ **"Better than all other ML tools"**: Better in some areas, worse in others

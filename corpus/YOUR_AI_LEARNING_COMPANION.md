## 💡 Example Session

```
You: learn classification

[Explanation]
   Classification predicts discrete categories (like spam/not spam).

[Examples]
   1. Email spam detection
   2. Image classification
   3. Sentiment analysis

[Key Terms]
   categories, classes, labels, accuracy

[Learning Tips]
   • Focus on understanding 'Classification predicts discrete...'
   • Master these key terms: categories, classes, labels
   • Think about real-world examples: Email spam detection
   • Next, explore: regression

[Practice Suggestions]
   • Try building a spam email classifier
   • Practice with the Iris dataset

You: ask what is the difference between classification and regression?

[Answer]
   Classification predicts discrete categories (like spam/not spam),
   while regression predicts continuous values (like prices or temperatures).

You: progress

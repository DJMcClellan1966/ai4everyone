## 🎯 Usage

### **Basic Usage**
```python
from advanced_learning_companion import AdvancedLearningCompanion

companion = AdvancedLearningCompanion()

# Learn a concept
result = companion.learn_concept_advanced('classification')

# Ask a question
result = companion.answer_question_advanced("What is deep learning?")

# Get learning path
result = companion.suggest_personalized_path('deep_learning')

# Check progress
result = companion.assess_progress_advanced()
```

### **With Enhanced UI**
```python
# Use the enhanced UI with advanced companion

## 🧠 Brain Processing Example

When you learn a concept, the brain processes it:

```
1. Attention: Focuses on key terms
2. Working Memory: Adds concept to active learning
3. Episodic Memory: Checks if learned before
4. Semantic Memory: Retrieves related knowledge
5. Metacognition: Assesses learning readiness
6. Pattern Abstraction: Finds similar concepts
```

**Result:**
- Working Memory Items: 2
- Cognitive Load: 2.00
- Past Learning Sessions: 1
- Semantic Knowledge Retrieved: 3

## 🤔 Socratic Questions Example

For "classification", you get:

1. **Clarification**: "What do you mean by 'Classification predicts discrete categories'?"
2. **Assumption**: "What assumptions are you making about classification?"
3. **Evidence**: "What evidence supports classification?"
4. **Implication**: "What are the implications of classification?"

These questions help you **think deeper** about concepts!

## 📈 Learning Analytics

The advanced companion tracks:

- **Concept Mastery**: How well you know each concept (0-1)
- **Learning Velocity**: How fast you learn

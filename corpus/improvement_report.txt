IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

[High] Performance - Speed
Issue: Average training time is 6.07s (high)
Recommendations:
  - Add model caching for repeated training
  - Optimize data preprocessing pipeline
  - Add parallel processing where possible
  - Use more efficient data structures

[Medium] Features
Issue: Some advanced features not tested
Recommendations:
  - Add deep learning benchmarks
  - Test advanced preprocessing features
  - Benchmark AutoML capabilities
  - Test model registry and versioning
  - Test pre-trained model hub

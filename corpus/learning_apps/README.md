# Learning Apps — What Was Done

Remaining books and areas in ML-ToolBox were turned into **separate learning apps**, with related topics **combined where it made sense**. Each app lives in its **own named folder** under `learning_apps/` and exposes a slim Flask UI (By Book / By Level, curriculum, optional demos).

All run commands assume you are in the **repo root** (`ML-ToolBox`).

## Conventions

- **Paths**: From each lab’s `app.py`, repo root is `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]`; lab root is `Path(__file__).parent`. Same in each lab’s `demos.py` for REPO.
- **Structure**: Each lab has `curriculum.py` (LEVELS, BOOKS, CURRICULUM + getters), `demos.py` (`run_demo`, DEMO_HANDLERS or stub), `app.py` (Flask, `/api/health`, `/api/curriculum`, `/api/curriculum/book/<id>`, `/api/curriculum/level/<level>`, `/api/try/<demo_id>`, `/`), and its own `README.md`.
- **Ports**: 5001 (ml_learning_lab), 5002–5013 for the labs under `learning_apps/` (clrs, deep_learning, ai_concepts, cross_domain, python_practice, sicp, practical_ml, rl, probabilistic_ml, ml_theory, llm_engineers, math_for_ml).

## Adding demos

Labs that currently have a demos stub (ai_concepts_lab, cross_domain_lab, python_practice_lab, practical_ml_lab, rl_lab, probabilistic_ml_lab, ml_theory_lab) can add runnable demos in their `demos.py`: implement `run_demo(demo_id)` and, if desired, wire `try_demo` in curriculum items to those demo IDs.
